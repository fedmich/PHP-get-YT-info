I know YouTube API can be used and setup for a proper long term solution.

This is meant to be a quick drop in solution to assist our apps get basic info from YouTube.

Usage: 
http://localhost/watchlist/get/?id=<VIDEO_ID>

returns a JSON with vid_id and title


Want to see how I coded it from beginning?
